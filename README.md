# The 13th Summer Research Project
**Definition:** Middle East Technical University Mechanical Engineering Department Summer Research Project about Tuned Mass Dampers

**Software used:** MathWorks Matlab

**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Instructor:** Prof. Dr. Ender Ciğeroğlu


   The project is aimed to be familiar with the vibration optimization of the structural masses with tuned mass damper systems. For the optimization purposes Matlab functions are used such as fminsearch, fmincon and ode45. Starting from single tuned mass damper system to multiple mass damper systems, several different cases are observed and compared. Firstly single mass damper system optimization is done. Then, parallel and series configuration of double mass damper systems are examined. Also, non-linear spring response is checked.
